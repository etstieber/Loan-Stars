## Introduction  <a name="introduction"></a>

The main goal of this project is to explore efficient machine learning models that can best predict loan defaults using data such as standard loan factors, macroeconomic data, and market conditions.  

## Methodology <a name="meth"></a>

We outlined and completed this project through steps of:

- Data Collection
- EDA
- Pre-processing
- Optimizing
- Model Selection

Here is some code that we used to develop our analysis.
 
### Data Collection <a name="DC"></a>
```python
Data Collection Code Here.
``` 
 
### EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis <a name="EDA"></a>
```python
EDA Code Here.
```

### Pre-processing <a name="PP"></a>
```python
PP Code Here.
``` 

### Optimizing <a name="Op"></a>
```python
Optimizing Code Here.
``` 

### Model Selection <a name="MS"></a>
```python
Model Selection Code Here.
``` 

**You have to copy in output/figures from the notebooks.**


### Subsection 2 <a name="subsec2-2"></a>
This is a subsection, formatted in heading 3 style

## Analysis Section <a name="section3"></a>

Here are some graphs that we created in our analysis. We saved them to the `pics/` subfolder and include them via the usual markdown syntax for pictures.
